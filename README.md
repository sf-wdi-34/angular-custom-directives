## Custom Directives - Intro (10 mins)

As you've seen by now, a huge amount of the code you work with in Angular are directives. Angular was designed to be an extension of HTML - a way to have custom-defined interactive tags of your own making.

While we've been getting good at using the directives that come with Angular, it's time to start seeing what we can do if we start making some up.

One of the most obvious _uses_ of this is when you've got repetitive code to render some information or data. If you're repeating a set of similar markup (or a component) on several different pages, it's a simple DRY principle to consolidate that code into one place. Otherwise, you might forget a tag in one place or decide to change something and have to change it several places.
t
By extracting your component to a custom directive, we can just reference that directive whenever we need to use it and not worry about repeating the code to render it.

#### Real World Example

As an example, we're going to mess around with duplicating something that's becoming a common pattern in interface design – the concept of a card. Applications like Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, and a lot more are moving towards this design pattern.

<img width="571" alt="Twitter" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25366/9665317/4f8a5e56-5224-11e5-9b9c-fe62d8a6cdf4.png">

Everyone's favorite CSS framework, Bootstrap, is even on board, where in [version 4+ you're able to create a card](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/) with just some CSS classes:

<img width="346" alt="Bootstrap" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25366/9665376/c2bcac6c-5224-11e5-8e4c-807a19a4432a.png">

Let's see if we can make something similar, wrapped up in our own custom HTML element.

## Know The Code - Independent (5 mins)

<!--Go ahead and grab the starter code, and take five minutes to inspect it.-->

<!--* Clone, or fork then clone, this repo.-->
<!--* Find the starter code in the the `starter-code/app/` directory.-->

<!--If you'd like to see it in your browser, you can:-->

<!--* Make sure to run `bower install`.-->
<!--* In the application directory run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.-->
<!--* Open your browser to "localhost:8000" (or similar).-->


Take five minutes and inspect our starter code in this repo's `starter-code/app/` directory. You'll see a pretty normal Angular app, and since we're repeating using those cards, and there's a few consistent tags we're repeating every time we render a card, we're going to experiment with making those cards a custom-defined directive.

## Building a Simple Directive - Code demo (15 mins)

Using our starter code, our goal is to take:

```html
<div class='card'>
  <h4 class="card-title">{{card.question}}</h4>
  <h6>Cards Against Assembly</h6>
</div>
```

and end up with a reusable `<wdi-card></wdi-card>` component, maybe something like:

```html
<wdi-card question="{{card.question}}"></wdi-card>
```

### Let's be organized!

Rather than just throw this wherever, let's add it to our existing app.js
Of course, it could be named anything, but it's and it's a card directive, so `cardDirective` felt right. Up to you.

#### Directives are as easy as...

Just like controllers, factories, anything else we've made in angular, the first line is a simple extension of `angular`:

```js
angular
  .module('CardsAgainstAssembly', [])
  .directive('wdiCard', CardDirective);
```

An important thing to point out: The first argument is the name of the directive and how you'll use it in your HTML; and remember, Angular converts `camelCase` to `snake-case` for us, so if you want to use `<secret-garden></secret-garden>` in your HTML, name your directive `.directive('secretGarden', myFunctionIHaventMadeYet)`.  Here we use 'wdiCard' in the javascript, knowing that it will be `wdi-card` in the HTML.

#### Let's make a function!

Now, we obviously need a function named `CardDirective`!

```js
function CardDirective(){
  var directive = {};
  return directive;
}
```

NWhen making a directive, you use a **Directive Definition Object** to specify the capabilities of your directive. The **Directive Definition Object** has specific keys that it expects in order to define attributes and behavior of your directive.

## Directive Options

You've got a couple interesting options when making your own directives. We'll go through them all, quickly, and you can play with them on your own in a bit.

1. `restrict`
2. `template/templateUrl`
3. `replace`
4. `scope`

#### 1. `restrict`

While the name isn't obvious, the `restrict` option lets us decide what _kind_ of directive we want to make. It looks like this:

```js
restrict: 'EACM',
```

- `E` is element. An HTML element, like `<wdi-card></wdi-card>`
- `A` is attribute. Like `<div wdi-card="something"></div>`
- `C` is class. Like `<div class="wdi-card"></div>`
- `M` is comment. Like `<!-- directive: wdi-card -->`

You can choose to have just one, all of the above, or any combination you like. You should steer towards elements & attributes as much as possible, though – classes can get messy with other CSS classes, and comments could just end up weird if there isn't a good reason for it.

For ours, let's play with just an element.

```js
function CardDirective(){
  var directive = {
    restrict: 'E'
  };
  return directive;
}
```

#### 2. `template/templateUrl`

This is where our partial view comes in. Now, if it's a pretty tiny, self-contained directive, you can use `template: <p> "Some javascript " + string + " concatenation"</p>`

But that easily starts getting ugly, so it's often better (even for small directives like this) to make a quick little partial HTML file and reference it with `templateUrl` instead.

Let's extract our existing card tags, and throw them in a partial. Cut out:

```html
<div class='card'>
  <h4 class="card-title">{{card.question}}</h4>
  <h6>Cards Against Assembly</h6>
</div>
```

Quickly `touch templates/cardDirective.html` or some similarly obvious-named template, and paste it back in.

```html
<!-- templates/cardDirective.html -->
<div class='card'>
  <h4 class="card-title">{{card.question}}</h4>
  <h6>Cards Against Assembly</h6>
</div>
```

In `scripts/cardDirective.js`, we can add our option:

```js
function CardDirective(){
  var directive = {
    //'A' == attribute, 'E' == element, 'C' == class
    restrict: 'E',
    templateUrl:  'templates/cardDirective.html'
  };

  return directive;
}
```

#### 3. `replace`

Replace is pretty straightforward. Should this directive replace the HTML that calls the directive? Do you want it to get rid of what's in the template & swap it out with the template we're going to make? Or add to it, and not remove the original. For example, replacing would mean:

```html
<div ng-repeat="card in cardsCtlr.questionList" >
  <wdi-card></wdi-card>
</div>
```

Would actually render as:

```html
<div ng-repeat="card in cardsCtlr.questionList" >
  <div class='card'>
    <h4 class="card-title">{{question}}</h4>
    <h6>Cards Against Assembly</h6>
  </div>
</div>
```


See, `<wdi-card></wdi-card>` is gone, it's been replaced with the longer-form template that we defined above. Without replace, it would render as:

```html
<div ng-repeat="card in cardsCtlr.questionList" >
  <wdi-card>
    <div class='card'>
      <h4 class="card-title">{{question}}</h4>
      <h6>Cards Against Assembly</h6>
    </div>
  </wdi-card>
</div>
```


Let's say we like the replace option for our example. We simply add `replace: true` to our directive definition object:

```js
function CardDirective(){
  var directive = {
    restrict: 'E',
    replace: true,
    templateUrl:  'templates/cardDirective.html'
  };
  return directive;
}
```

### Get it connected

And lastly, in our `index.html`, let's finally use our custom directive. So exciting. This is it. Here we go.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div class='col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-4' ng-repeat="card in cardsCtlr.questionList" >
  <wdi-card></wdi-card>
</div>
```

TRY IT! So awesome! We've now got this much more readable `index.html`, with a _very_ semantic HTML tag describing exactly what we want rendered.

<img width="965" alt="Cards Against Assembly" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25366/9666972/05a2f348-522e-11e5-8f6c-7c503032eff4.png">

This is awesome. This is a great, reusable component. Except for _one_ thing.

#### 4. `scope`

If you notice, our template uses ``{{card.question}}`` inside it. This obviously works perfectly - we're geniuses. But what if we wanted to render a card somewhere outside of that `ng-repeat`, where `card in cards.questions` isn't a thing. What if we want to render a one-off card, reusing our awesome new directive elsewhere? Isn't that part of the point?

It sure is. We're lacking a precise scope.

Just like controllers, we want to define what our scope is. We want to be able to say "Render a card, with these details, in whatever context I need to render it in." A card shouldn't rely on a controller's data to know what information to render inside it. The controller should pass that data to our directive, so it's freestanding and not relying on anyone but itself.

That's where `scope` comes in, and this lets us decide what attributes our element should have! For example, in our card example, maybe we want to render a card with just a string somewhere outside of this controller. We want to make our own card with our own hardcoded text.

Try this. In your `index.html`, adjust our `<card>` element to say:

```html
<wdi-card question="{{card.question}}"></wdi-card>
```

In context, you'll see that the `ng-repeat` is giving us the variable `card`, and we're actually just rendering that out as a string. But we've decided we want to have an attribute called `question` to pass data through. We made that up, it's appropriate to our example, but it can be anything.

There are only two other pieces we need to make this reality.

In our `_cardView.html` partial, let's adjust to:

```html
<div class='card'>
  <h4 class="card-title">{{question}}</h4>
  <h6>Cards Against Assembly</h6>
</div>
```

No longer reliant on a variable named `card`, it's now just reliant on an element having the attribute of `question`.

And finally, in `js/app.js`:

```js
angular
  .module('CardsAgainstAssembly',[])
  .directive('wdiCard', CardDirective);

function CardDirective(){
  var directive = {
    //'A' == attribute, 'E' == element, 'C' == class, 'M' == comment
    restrict : 'E',
    replace : true,
    templateUrl :  "_cardView.html",
    scope : {
        question: '@'
    }
  };
  return directive;
}
```

In `scope`, we just define an object. The key is whatever want the attribute on the element to be named. So if we want `<wdi-card bagel=""></wdi-card>`, then we'd need a key named `bagel` in our scope object.

#### The Different Types of Scope for a Directive
The _value_ is one of 3 options.

```js
scope: {
  sendTo: '=',     // Bind the ngModel to the object given
  onSend: '&',      // Pass a reference to an expression or function
  fromName: '@'     // Store the string associated with fromName
}
```

The corresponding options would look like:

```html
<div scope-example send-to="to" on-send="sendMail(email)" from-name="ari@fullstack.io" />
```

The `=` is a mechanism for binding data that might change (often objects); the `&` is for passing a reference to a function you might want to call; and the `@` is simply storing a string & passing it through to the template.

#### Since we've decided to use `@`/strings, let's try it!

Our last test is to see if we can make a card using just a hardcoded string. Then we'll know our card is really reusable.

Somewhere _outside_ the context of the controller, let's say just above the footer in our `index.html`, throw a handmade card in:

```html
<!-- ... -->
</section>
<hr/>
<wdi-card question="Why is Angular so awesome?"></wdi-card>
<footer>
<!-- ... -->
```

Would you look at that? Our own custom directive - a reusable, semantic HTML component that we designed ourselves.


### A deeper dive on the directive definition object

Check out this [directive definition object cheat sheet from egghead.io](https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/pdf/egghead-io-directive-definition-object-cheat-sheet.pdf). Specifically look at the `controller` and `link` options that can add functionality to a directive.

We can use directives as simple templating as we did above with the card directive, but we can also make directives that have their own behaviors!

Our code can be separated into small, organized pieces that have a single representation in the code as a directive.

<!--
### Integrate a third party directive

UI Bootstrap provides a wide array of useful directives that can bring cool functionality to your applications! Let's integrate the [ui bootstrap rating widget](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/rating) into our Cards Against Assembly app. -->

<!-- #### Resolving dependencies

UI Bootstrap has a handful of dependencies that we need to integrate before this directive will work.

Use bower to install `bootstrap`, `angular-animate`, `angular-sanitize`, and of course, UI bootstrap itself, which is called `angular-bootstrap` when you download it.

In your index.html, include all of these dependencies:

```html
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-animate/angular-animate.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-bootstrap/ui-bootstrap-tpls.min.js"></script>

<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/controllers/cardsController.js"></script>

<link href="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
Include these dependencies in app.js as well

```javascript
angular.module('CardsAgainstAssembly', ['ngAnimate', 'ngSanitize','ui.bootstrap']);

``` -->

#### Building a controller

Using the [rating widget demo's js file](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/rating) as your starting point, build a `rateController` with the necessary attributes. Remember that the example uses `$scope` and we'll use the `vm` syntax:

```javascript

angular.module('CardsAgainstAssembly')
  .controller('rateController', rateController);

function rateController(){
  var vm = this;
  vm.rate = 7;
  vm.max = 10;

  // etc... keep filling in the controller so that it has all of the
  // attributes that the demo has
}
```

Make sure to list `rateController` as a `<script>` in `index.html`!

#### Including the HTML

In a section below the cards, use the rating directive to add a feedback mechanism for users. Note again, the demo provides a good start, but we need to adjust the syntax for our case, adding `rateCtrl` where appropriate:
```html
<section ng-controller="rateController as rateCtrl">
  <h2>Rate our app!</h2>
  <span uib-rating ng-model="rateCtrl.rate" max="rateCtrl.max" read-only="rateCtrl.isReadonly" on-hover="rateCtrl.hoveringOver(value)" on-leave="rateCtrl.overStar = null" titles="['one','two','three']" aria-labelledby="default-rating"></span>
</section>
```

Use the demo as inspiration to add additional features as desired!



## Independent Practice (15 minutes)

Now, while we dove pretty deep into explaining each part, you can see it's really just a combination of quickly defining a custom directive, what options you want, making a template, and then _using_ it.

For practice, let's break up into pairs and make something extra.

If you didn't notice, there's some extra code included in your starter `index.html`:

```html
<header class='navbar'>
  <h1 class='pull-left'>Cards Against Assembly</h1>

  <scores></scores>
</header>
```

Our goal is to craft a custom directive to show off our players scores, like so:

<img width="965" alt="Scores" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25366/9669340/3b316dc0-523b-11e5-8e7d-036a8a140d7e.png">

As a pair, build a custom directive that makes use of the `PlayersController` included in your starter code, listing out each player & their score, built as a custom `<score></score>` directive.

You have 15 minutes! Go!
